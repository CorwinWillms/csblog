            <h1>What is NPM? </h1>
            <p>
                The fastest way to describe NPM is to say it is the free package manager and installer for Node.js. NPM was created in 2009 as an open source project and today it is the primary way Node.js developers install and manage JavaScript packages. 
            </p>

            <p>
                NPM is still open source. It is the largest open source software registry. In fact, it is the largest software registry period. In 2018 the NPM registry achieved over a billion downloads in a single day. There are over 800,000 packages available for download through NPM. 
            </p>

            <p>
                npm, Inc. was founded in 2014 to help manage the NPM software registry and offer additional JavaScript package managing services that arenâ€™t free with NPM. In 2020 they were purchased by Microsoft owned GitHub.

                NPM is very easy to use. It is installed after installing Node using the following command:
            </p>
            <div class="terminal-command">
                <pre class="terminal-command">
                    
                    <code>
                        npm install -g npm
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                After installing the latest version of NPM, you can install a package in the NPM registry with:
            </p>

            <div>
                <pre class="terminal-command">
                    
                    <code>
                        npm install PACKAGE-NAME
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
