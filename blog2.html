        <h1>What is AWS Lambda? 9/10/2021</h1>
        <p>
            AWS Lambda is a serverless, cheap way to run code. Code is 
            run in response to events. These events can come from other AWS
            services or any web app. Lambda is compatible with Java, Python, C#,
            Go, PowerShell, Node.js and Ruby. Every time a Lambda is triggered
            by an event a container is created. When the Lambda function runs to
            completion the resources used by the container are reclaimed. Because
            a new container is created every time the Lambda is triggered, 
            Lambdas are highly scalable. When the Lambda receives more events,
            it makes more containers, and when the events have been handled, 
            everthing scales back down automatically. 
        </p>

            Over the summer, I wrote a Lambda function in Python for my internship.
            I was amazed at how easy it was to deploy my code. The function I
            wrote was triggered by an AWS API Gateway. When the API Gateway 
            received a POST request, the event was sent to the Lambda to be handled.
            Because AWS only charges for the time when the code is running, the 
            cost to run this Lambda was almost nothing. Because of the way Lambda 
            works with Python functions, I was able to access the data from 
            the requests directly from a provided Python Dictionary. It was 
            surprisingly easy to get my Python function handling POST requests
            quickly and for almost no cost.
