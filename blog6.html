            <h1>Blog Post 6: What is ECMA?</h1>
            <p>
                ECMAScript is a programming language standard maintained by ECMA International. If youâ€™ve ever written JavaScript code, chances are you were actually writing in ECMAScript because the JavaScript language conforms almost completely to the ECMAScript standards. Some differences do exist because experimental JavaScript features may not have been added to the standard yet. You might be wondering, who are ECMA International?

                ECMA International is a rebrand of the former European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). ECMA began in 1960 when a group of European computing companies met in Brussels to discuss the standardization of computing. By the summer of 1961, the first official assembly of the ECMA met in Geneva Switzerland. In 1997, the developers of JavaScript at Netscape allowed ECMA to create a specification for the language. This language specification ECMA-262 standardizes the ECMAScript/JavaScript that we use today. ECMA-262 has been through several versions and is still being updated.
