        <h1>What is the difference between Java and JavaScript? </h1>
        <p>I have been programming in Java for two years now. Over this
            time I have heard about another language called JavaScript but I
            had never looked into what this other language was about or why
            its name has "Java" in is name. The only thing I knew about JavaScript before writing
            this blog post was that it had something to do with web development.
        </p>
        <p>It turns out, Java and JavaScript don't have a lot in common. They are 
            not even the same type of language. Java is a an object oriented 
            programming language, while JavaScript is a scripting language. JavaScript
            is only run in a browser, while Java can be run elsewhere. Java code needs
            to be compiled, while JavaScript is not. 
        </p>
        <p> From what I can tell, the only thing connecting Java and JavaScript
            is their names. Apparently, the only reason they even share that is
            that the company that was developing what would become JavaScript saw how popular Java was 
            getting and changed the name of their language to get more traction. 
            I'm sure this is the first of many discoveries I will make this semester 
            about how history has affected web developement in ways that don't 
            completely make sense.

        <h2>You can quickly see the difference between the two languages 
            by looking at how they print to the console:
        </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Java: System.out.print("Hello World");</li>
            <li>JavaScript: console.log("Hello World");</li>
        </ul>
