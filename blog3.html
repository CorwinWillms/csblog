        <h1>(Some of)The Power & History of CSS 9/18/2021</h1>
        <p>
            Most websites today are fairly easy on the eyes, but there was a time when this
            was not the case. If you look at pictures of old websites you can see we have come
            a long way since the early days of the internet in terms of web design. CSS is a huge reason why. 
            For example look at these images of the CSS Wikipedia page with and without styling
            that comes from css.
        </p> 
        <div class="style_pics">
            <img src="csswikistyle.PNG"></img>
            <img src="csswikinostyle.PNG"></img>
        </div>
        <p> 
            The difference between a page that only uses html and one that uses styling is
            pretty remarkable. It is surprising then that it took quite some time for CSS to 
            gain widespread use. CSS was created in the mid-90s but it took years for it enter 
            common use. The main issue was that the browsers at the time had varying levels 
            of compatibility with CSS. A site with CSS styling might have look completely 
            different or broken altogether depending on what browser was used. Thankfully 
            after some clever lobbying by CSS enthusiasts, browsers became almost completely 
            compatible with CSS. The web is better for it!
        </p>
        <p>Here is the (very basic) CSS that I used for this page:</p>
        <div class="code_example">
            <pre>
                
                <code>
                    body {
                        background-color: aquamarine;
                        justify-content: center;
                    }   
        
                    img {
                        height: 350px;
                        width: 500px;
                    }
        
                    .style_pics {
                        justify-content: space-around;
                        flex-direction: center;
                    }
        
                    code {
                        border: black solid;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
